Google Search Trends Analysis

Project Overview 
This project analyzes Google Search Trends over time, focusing on how search queries related to Data Science and other technology fields have evolved. By leveraging Python, the Google Trends API, and visualization tools, this project uncovers patterns in search behavior and helps identify seasonality, emerging trends, and global interest shifts.

Objectives
* Extract and analyze search trend data using the Google Trends API.
* Perform time series analysis to identify long-term and seasonal trends.
* Visualize trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Provide insights into user interest in Data Science over time.

Dataset
* Source: Google Trends API
* Data Points: Search interest over time (normalized values)
* Variables:
    * Search Term: The keyword analyzed (e.g., Data Science)
    * Date: The timeframe of the search trends
    * Interest: A value between 0-100 representing search popularity

Tools & Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pytrends API)
* Google Trends API (to fetch search trend data)
* Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and visualization)

Key Insights Overall Trend in Data Science Searches
* Data Science searches have been increasing steadily since 2015, showing continuous growth in interest. Seasonality and Peaks
* Notable peaks in search interest occur around January and September, possibly due to new year resolutions and academic cycles. Regional Analysis
* The highest interest in Data Science searches comes from countries like United States, India, and Canada, indicating strong demand in these regions.

Step-by-Step Process
1. Fetch data from Google Trends API for selected keywords.
2. Preprocess and clean the extracted data.
3. Analyze trends using Pandas and visualizations.
4. Interpret search patterns and derive insights.
5. Export results for further use.

How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/hridaymehta10/google-trends-analysis.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd google-trends-analysis
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script: jupyter notebook OR python google_search_analysis.py

Conclusion 
This analysis demonstrates how Google Search Trends can be leveraged to understand shifts in public interest over time. The findings can be useful for marketers, educators, and industry professionals in making data-driven decisions based on search behavior.
